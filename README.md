# Salinity-Data

#For this project, I compared the salinity data from World Ocean 2013 and 2018. The data I used for this project was from https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa18/woa18data.html and https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/woa13data.html. The Ocean Climate Laboratory team used the CTD to measure different types of data from the oceans. Once the conductivity and temperature has been measured, you can calculate the salinity within the ocean.
